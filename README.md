##The repository contains:

1- an image file im.npy of a woman

2- a mask file mask.npy - 2d array of the labels for the different items of cloth

- input: image and mask
- output: spatially averaged "MR8" filter responses, for a given sample size, from a given clothing label.
          and ravelled to give a 1-d final vector.

4- code for the filters
